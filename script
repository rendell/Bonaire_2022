## Loading

The data file Bonaire is to be refreshed daily by downloading two .csv files from Surveysparrow and uploading it onto the Rstudio cloud workbench. The files are for the online version and offline versions of the same survey.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Online data
Online_Bonaire <- read.csv("/cloud/project/Online_Bonaire.csv")

# Offline data
Offline_Bonaire <-read.csv("/cloud/project/Offline_Bonaire.csv")

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)
library(OpenStreetMap)
library(ggmap)
library(parzer)
```

The dataset is passed in the "tibble" format and incomplete submissions are filtered out.

```{r}
Bonaire<- Bonaire%>% 
  as_tibble()%>%
  filter(Completion=="Completed")

##%>%
##  distinct(IP_adress, .keep_all= TRUE)
```

The age variable in the survey is defined as a numerical field. For analysis we convert the data into intervals. categories still have to be properly defined and perhaps we will create some alternatives.

```{r}
Bonaire$Q2 <- 
  ifelse((Bonaire$Q2>=15)&
           (Bonaire$Q2 <= 19),
         "15-19",
  ifelse((Bonaire$Q2 >= 20)&
                  (Bonaire$Q2 <= 39),
                "20-39",
  ifelse((Bonaire$Q2 >= 40)&
                  (Bonaire$Q2 <= 59),
                "40-59",
  ifelse((Bonaire$Q2 >= 60)&
                  (Bonaire$Q2 <= 79),
                "60-79",       
                ifelse(Bonaire$Q2> 80,"80+","NA")
         ))))
```

```{r}
Bonaire <- Bonaire %>% separate(DMS, c('Long', 'Lat'),",",remove=FALSE)

Bonaire <- Bonaire %>%
  mutate(Long = parzer::parse_lon(Long),
         Lat = parzer::parse_lat(Lat))
# parzer not working yet.
```
### Q3
```{r}
Cleaning <-Bonaire%>%select(Q3,
                            O1,
                            O2,
                            Submission_id)
write.csv(Cleaning,"cleaning_set.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


### IP frequency
```{r}
IP_frequency <- sort(table(Bonaire$IP_adress),decreasing=T)
```


### Language
```{r}
table(Bonaire$Language_name)
```

  
### SP_1



## Tabulating

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print('Total surveys collected: ')
print(nrow(Bonaire))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print('Online surveys collected: ')
print(sum(is.na(Bonaire$Device_name)))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print('Offline surveys collected: ')
print(nrow(Bonaire)-sum(is.na(Bonaire$Device_name)))
```


### Qualifying questions

```{r}
Q1 <- data.frame(table(Bonaire$Q1))
Q2 <- data.frame(table(Bonaire$Q2))
Q3 <- data.frame(table(Bonaire$Q3))
D3 <- data.frame(table(Bonaire$D3))
D4 <- data.frame(table(Bonaire$D4))

Q1 <- Bonaire %>% count(Q1, sort = TRUE)
Q2 <- Bonaire %>% count(Q2, sort = TRUE)
Q3 <- Bonaire %>% count(Q3, sort = TRUE)
D3 <- Bonaire %>% count(D3, sort = TRUE)
D4 <- Bonaire %>% count(D4, sort = TRUE)

Q1
Q2
Q3
D3 #Where you born on Bonaire?
D4
```

```{r}
Device_name <-data.frame(table(Bonaire$Device_name))
as_tibble(Device_name, sort=TRUE)
```


#### Map
Intention to vizualize Bonaire map with offline survey responses.
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
Bonmap <- get_stamenmap(bbox = c(left = -68.44559, 
                                    bottom = 12.02113, 
                                    right = -68.17368, 
                                    top = 12.32318),
                           zoom = 12, 
                           maptype = "watercolor")
ggmap(Bonmap)
```

Still need to link up with the observations
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}


ggmap(Bonmap) + # the base map
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.003, height = 0.003),
              data = df, aes(x = x, y = y), 
             color = "#fc8b9b",
             alpha = 7/10)+
  ggtitle("Individual survey responses")  +  
  theme_void()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#fc8b9b", size=14, face="bold.italic"),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
  axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )
